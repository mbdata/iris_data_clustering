# Clustering Analysis with the Iris Dataset

We will be performing a clustering analysis on the Iris data, one of the most popular datasets used in pattern recognition. The dataset consists of 3 classes with 50 instances each, and each class refers to a type of iris plant.

**Attribute Information:** The data contains 4 measurement attributes and one predicted attribute, the iris class:

```*Sepal length in cm
*Sepal width in cm
*Petal length in cm
*Petal width in cm
*Class: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, Iris Virginica
```
**Requirements:** We are using Jupyter Notebook found in the Anaconda Python Distribution. It has all the libraries we require here, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and SciKit-Learn. However, you can use whichever IDE you like.
